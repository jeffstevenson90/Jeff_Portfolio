# Project 2: xTeam Call Reduction
* Supported a xTeam collaboration project to identify solutions for reducing non-value calls to key partners.
* Worked with teams including Product, Dev, Operational leaders and other key stakeholders to identify non-value work.
* Researched demographics of over 1M items to find which ones were more (or less) likely to be resolved regardless of if we made a call or not.
* Provided analysis and recommendations on which areas we could target, as well as testing support and self-service dashboards for monitoring changes.
* The change resulted in enhanced client relations, as well as a $250K per year efficiency gain for our operations department.
